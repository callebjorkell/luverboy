 Quick Luverboy Introduction
 ===========================

 This quick tutorial was created to give you a quick overview of how Luverboy
 works, and what the most important commands are.

 Luverboy is an eggdrop bot, which means that he is a piece of software that
 communicates with an IRC server. He is also connected to a MySQL database via
 the TCL script that makes up Luverboy's brain. Because he uses a MySQL
 database to store data, it is very easy to connect other frontends to the
 same system. For my clan (Love Messengers) I have integrated our homepage
 (http://luvers.nrgizer.com) to use the same data. This means that all
 information that Luverboy adds, changes, or retrieves is the same as on the
 homepages. He can show matchstats, clan information and even add clanwars.
 Even more than this, he can independantly find clanwars and make a suggestion
 as to what the scores, maps, frags and opponents were. He needs some help to
 make sure that the guess was correct, but in about 99% of the cases, he is
 spot on.


 Access levels
 -------------

 There are four different access levels for the bot. Regular user, voiced
 user, luver, and owner. All levels, except owner, are determined by the
 status on the irc channels: A regular user is a user that doesn't have voice.
 A minimum set of functions are available to these users, such as for example
 !cwspy. Voiced are users that have either voice, or op on the public channel.
 These voiced users have access to a few more commands, but most are still
 unavailable. A luver is determined to be a luver if he/she has op on the
 private channel, this means that if you want to use all Luverboys commands,
 you need to be opped here. You can get ops by:

 <NRGizeR> /msg Luverboy !op mys3cretpass

 The last class (owner) is determined by eggdrop's own user system (a user
 with the m flag set). This class has access to all commands, which include
 the !addtrial, and !promotetrial commands for example. These are kept as
 owner-only commands as they introduce new users to Luverboy.


 Help
 ----

 Luverboy has a fully working help system that describes each and all commands
 that are available. !help will give you a list of commands that are available
 to you, and !help command will print a more detailed help for the given
 command. For example:

 <NRGizeR> !help luverstats
 <Luverboy> [help] Shows stats for the given luver. If a luver is not
     specified, general statistics about the luvers is printed.
 <Luverboy> [help] Syntax: !luverstats [membername/ircnick]
 <Luverboy> [help] Example: !luverstats Remo
 <Luverboy> [help] Related commands: listluvers, luverinfo, luverphone, setphone


 Match finding
 -------------

 Luverboy has several functions to make match searching and server finding as
 easy as possible. You can do a matchsearch with !3on3, !4on4 and so on,
 depending on the number of players we have. This will turn on z0rbots
 matchsearch function, so keep an eye on the public irc channel after that.

 The !hl command can be used to highlight all opped nicks on the private
 channel, so that you can ask everyone online if they want to play or not.
 Note that this function only highlights opped users, so if you don't want to
 be highlighted just remove your ops in the private channel. You can later
 regain them by using the !op command as described in the "Access levels"
 topic.


 cwspy
 -----

 cwspy is what the automatical cw finder is called. This part of the Luverboy
 script scans servers once every 2 minutes to find a clan server where at
 least three or more own clan tags are found. After three tags have been
 located on one clan server, and the scores is something other than 0-0,
 Luverboy will assume that a CW has started. After two maps have been played
 against the same opponent, Luverboy will assume that the CW is over, and
 print a suggestion in the private irc channel. This suggestion is accepted
 with !cwspyok. The scores in an ongoing match can be checked at any time with
 !cwspy


 Statistics
 ----------

 Because of the MySQL database that Luverboy uses to save information, it is
 very easy to generate a multitude of stats. At the time of writing, Luverboy
 can produce map specific stats with !mapstats, luver specific stats with
 !luverstats and general stats with !cwstats. He can even show frags that
 individual luvers got in a specified CW with the help of !cwfrags or show
 general frag statistics for a given person with the !fragstats command. Get
 more information on how to use these commands with !help.

 -------
 On top of all this, Luverboy is able to do so much more! Just try the !help
 command to explore all options that the bot has!
